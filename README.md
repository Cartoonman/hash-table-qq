# hash-table-qq
Some hash table program I wrote in C++ for a challenge question for a internship. No success qq


<h1> Instructions </h1>
<br>
<p>This assignment was coded in C++ 11.<br>


Windows and Linux binaries have been supplied. I believe the Windows binary is compiled by MinGW64. Linux binary was complined with gcc in Linux.<br>


Source code can be compiled by any gcc compiler that supports C++11. No non-std libraries are required.<br>

Compile the main.cpp file to get the program. <br>
e.g. g++ main.cpp <br>

If you recieve errors, you may not have C++11 compiling enabled or supported. Try:<br>
g++ main.cpp -std=c++0x<br>
g++ main.cpp -std=c++11<br>
<br>
The command I used on Windows with MinGW64:<br>
g++ main.cpp g++ main.cpp -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++<br>
